Text Alignment w/ openFst
=========================

This is an example how to use openFst to align recognition
hypotheis to reference text, and calculate WER (Word Error
Rate).

How it works is to construct a fst network from reference
text with the option to all possible insertion, deletion
and substitution errors, compose with hypothesis fst, it
can be either a one best or lattice network, the shortest
path of the composition is the alignment.
